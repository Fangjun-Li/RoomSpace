This repository contains the code used to generate the dataset for the RoomSpace benchmark, as introduced in the IJCAI-24 paper, [Reframing Spatial Reasoning Evaluation in Language Models: A Real-World Simulation Benchmark for Qualitative Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.15064.pdf).

## üèòÔ∏è Room Scene Generation Code
This section guides you through setting up and running the room scene generation code, which is based on [ProcTHOR](https://procthor.allenai.org/). 

1. Install ProcTHOR.
   Detailed installation instructions can be found on the [ProcTHOR GitHub repository](https://github.com/allenai/procthor).
2. Replace and Add Files to Customize Room Generation
   Locate the `procthor` folder in your installation directory. 
   - Replace the corresponding files under `./procthor/procthor/generation` with the files from this repository in the same directory.
   - Copy the `generate_room.py` file under `./procthor/scripts` in this repository to the corresponding folder in the downloaded ProcTHOR directory.
3. Generate Room Scenes
   Navigate to the `./procthor` directory and run the example script to generate room scenes. Use the following command:
   ```bash
   python scripts/generate_room.py
   ```
   - Save path: By default, the script generates rooms for the SD-100 dataset. You can customize the `save_path` variable in the script to specify where the generated room configuration files should be saved.
   - Number of rooms: Adjust the loop `for i in range(0, 100)` to change the number of rooms generated.

**Check the Generated Meta Room Configuration Files**: After the script completes, check the `Meta/SD-100` folder. You should find the generated `.json` files for each room containing the configuration details.

## üì∑ Image & Video Generation Code
After generating the room configurations, you can create images and videos to visualize the rooms. Below are the steps to generate top-down views, robot perspective views, and videos.

- To get a top-down view image of each room:
  ```bash
  python draw_top-down.py
  ```

- To generate images from a robot's perspective at the south door of each room:
  ```bash
  python draw_robot-south.py
  ```
**Check the Generated Images**: After the script completes, check the `Data/SD-100/Image/top-down` and `Data/SD-100/Image/robot-south` folder. You should see the generated `.jpg` image files corresponding to each room JSON file.

- To create videos showing a 360-degree view of each room:
  ```bash
  python create_video.py
  ```
**Check the Generated Videos**: After the script completes, check the `Data/SD-100/Video/` folder. You should find the generated `.mp4` video files, with each video corresponding to a room JSON file.

## üíª Logical Reasoner
The `solver.py` module provides functions for solving spatial relationship constraints between objects within a grid of configurable size. 
### How to Use

1. **Set the Domain Size:**
   - Define the size of the grid (e.g., `(12, 12)` for a 12x12 grid) when calling `solve_single_candidate` or `solve_all_candidates`.

2. **Create Test Data:**
   - Define facts and queries for the relationships between objects within the grid. This data is passed into the `example` dictionary.

3. **Run the Solver:**
   - Use `solve_single_candidate` to check if a specific relationship holds true or `solve_all_candidates` to find all possible relationships.

### Example Usage

Here is how you might use the module in another script:

```python
from solver import solve_single_candidate, solve_all_candidates

# Set the domain size
domain_size = (12, 12)

# Define facts and queries
facts = [
    ("bed", "NER", "room"),
    ("dresser", "SWR", "room"),
    ("house plant", "ER", "room"),
    ("dining table", "CR", "room"),
    ("chair", "CR", "room"),
    ("bed", "NE", "dresser"),
    ("dresser", "SW", "house plant"),
    ("house plant", "SE", "dining table"),
    ("dining table", "N", "chair")
] 

query = [
    ("bed", "chair")
]

example = {'example_id': 0, "facts": facts, "query": query}

# Solving for a specific candidate relationship
yn_relation = "south-west"
solvable_answer, time_taken = solve_single_candidate(example, yn_relation, domain_size)
print(yn_relation, ":", solvable_answer, f"Time: {time_taken:.4f}s")

# Solving for all candidate relationships
solvable_relations, time_taken = solve_all_candidates(example, domain_size)
print("All Candidates:", solvable_relations, f"Time: {time_taken:.4f}s")
```
